# Things that are left to do

## Wait Play
-  ~~Animation~~ 
  - ~~Have an array of end Position of animation~~ 
- Add logic for when other player cannot play
  - Eg. All cards that are held are bigger than 31
- Add animation for when other player cannot play
  - In the online game they say "GO"

## Play View
- Shade cards or something for those cards you cant play maybe?
- Separate played cards that are over 31 from new running count
